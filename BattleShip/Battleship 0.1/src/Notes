JFrames - Creates a window where components can be added to give it life
	Canvas - Added to JFrame to allow for added graphics

Threads - Allows a program to run independently in a processor
	synchronized - Allows threads to run along side another program 
					and when changing a thread, nothing gets mixed.
					
try-catch block - A try block allows for the code inside to "try" and run the code
					and if it fails will go to a catch block. The catch block catches
					and exceptions in the code and throws a message.
					
Game loop:
	- init() method to initialize everything
	- tick() method to collect new data
	- render() method to render everything
		- private BufferStrategy bs;
		- private Graphics gs;
		- BufferStrategy: //Tells the screen what to draw by buffering, buffer - hidden computer screen 
			- Used with Canvas
			- Stops flickering
			Buffer -> Buffer - > Screen
		- Graphics - draws, similar to a paintbrush/pencil
			- bs.show() - after drawing is done
			- gs.dispose() - get's rid of old instructions (i think)
			- gs.clearRect(x, y, width, height) - will clear the given section of screen
			- gs.setColor(Color color) sets color to use 
res folders - res stand for resources and holds all the image resources
textures folder - hold all the images/textures
images are viewed and interprated as a BufferdImage Object
To use an image directly you must import the res folder to the build path
 - selct the project --> project --> properties --> java build path --> libraries -- > add class folder
 sprite sheet - an image that consists of all the images you will need/want for a game
 
 To see images in eclipse in the textures folder, you must hit F5
